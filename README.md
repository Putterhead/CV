## Peter Grant-Hay

I'm the sales guy who's curious about the world around him. My goal is to combine my passion for selling and my love for technology. I've enjoyed a successful career selling vehicles to C suite customers and international organisations from around the world, along the way experiencing first hand the automotive industry's pivot towards being more recognisable as a consumer electronics industry.
